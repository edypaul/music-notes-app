# Music Notes App

If you're a musician you most likely want to practice, chords, scales, or even songs in all keys. 
This simple app generates a random key / note so you can practice. Once you're done practicing in that key, you can go ahead and generate another random note. 
When you finish practicing something in all 12 keys you can delete all the previously generated keys / notes and practice again in all keys at random. 

You can also create a list of practice sessions that will store random notes. 
Let's say you want to practice the *Pentatonic Scale* in all keys: 

- Create a new practice box (that's just what I called it) with the name *Pentatonic Scale*. 
- Click *Practice*
- Generate a random note. 
- Practice the *Pentatonic Scale* in that key. 
- The next day, open the app and the *Pentatonic Scale* practice box. 
- Generate another note. 
- Keep practicing. 

To practice a song in all keys create a new practice box and follow the previous steps.
